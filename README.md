# Better C++
BC++, or Better C++, is a translation layer made for C++ in an attempt to make annoying syntax more readable and enjoyable. Made with C++23.

## Why?
This project was made primarily for me and writing NewASM; since I found several things in C++ very annoying, so I changed them with BC++.
So, in conclusion, "better" is stricly speaking from my own perspective.
